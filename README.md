# RbxTouchDataModel
RbxTouchDataModel is an open source project dedicated to creating a virtual machine on the ROBLOX host and running RCC and Arbiter on the virtual machine.
RbxTouchDataModel is dedicated to 2016M-2018L Clients, as hosting servers for your revival / ORC might be hard. We offer you an opportunity to host servers for free, with the access of the VM / Server you have created on OUR platform.

# How it Works, What it Uses

How RbxTouchDataModel Works:

* RbxTouchDataModel uses a L7 Protected WebServer to request a new VM using a new Ownership Function / Compatiblity in the ROBLOX Client
* The WebServer assigns a name, port, and IP Address to the VM / Server.
* ROBLOX VM Platform assigns the files for the server / VM.
* ROBLOX Runs a Service Pack (SP1) on Windows Service Pack 2008
* ROBLOX VM Platform runs RDP / UDP Access to the Server / VM using SOAP and RCCService.
* ROBLOX Transfers Ownership to your DESKTOP ID (Machine Signature, WindowsVista -> Windows 10+)

What RbxTouchDataModel Uses:
* ROBLOX VM Platform
* ROBLOX RCC & SOAP Protocols
* John Shedletsky's Edited Files (https://github.com/ui0ppk/roblox-master)
* POCNet VM Hosting Platform
* Network Cluster Platform
* RCC Render & Arbiter
